## Requirements

### Front-end developer assignment
The assignment is to rebuild the page that our merchants use to create and issue new
invoices. This is what it looks like:

![alt text](./src/assets/screen/screen.png)
The merchant should be able to add and remove products. Each product has a few
properties:
* product code
alphanumeric, optional
* description
at least 5 characters long, ignoring repeated whitespaces
* quantity
at least 1
* price in Euros
including the VAT, must be positive
* VAT rate in Italy different products can have different VAT rates (22, 10, 5 and 4%). 
* For this assignment
it‚Äôs fine to just consider 22% VAT, forget about the dropdown (unless you have time left üôÇ).
* Please show validation error messages for each field where needed. All fields are
required unless specified otherwise.
* Inputs containing prices should be automatically formatted in this form: ‚Ç¨149.99 .
Either while typing (with some kind of mask) or on blur.
* The last column of the table (‚ÄúNet‚Äù) should be automatically updated and should display
the final price without VAT , taking into account the original price and the quantity.
* Finally the merchant can specify a discount ‚Äì a positive amount ‚Äì that will be deducted
from the subtotal. 
* The ‚ÄúRound cents‚Äù button allows the merchant to quickly remove the
cents from the subtotal applying the appropriate discount.
